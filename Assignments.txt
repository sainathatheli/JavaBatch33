1)Write a program that prompts the user to input an integer and then outputs the number with the digits reversed. For example, if the input is 12345, the output should be 54321.

2)Write a program that reads a set of integers, and then prints the sum of the even and odd integers.

3)Write a program that prompts the user to input a positive integer. It should then output a message indicating whether the number is a prime number.

4)Write a do-while loop that asks the user to enter two numbers. The numbers should be added and the sum displayed. The loop should ask the user whether he or she wishes to perform the operation again. If so, the loop should repeat; otherwise it should terminate.
